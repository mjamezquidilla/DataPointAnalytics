    "\n",
    "1. Only the mean of the **Ethanol Extract of 400microgram/milliliter has an significant difference towards the mean of the Positive Control Population**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Other Extract means do not have significant difference towards the Positive Control Population\n",
    "\n",
    "Ways to improve result:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increase size of the sample population.** This method ensures that the sample population would be nearer to the normal distribution curve. Hence, more accuracy of the results may follow. This also ensures that the variance of the data will captured. 4 data points per sample population is quite low."
